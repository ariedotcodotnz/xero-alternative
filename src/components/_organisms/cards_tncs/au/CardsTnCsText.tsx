      any amendments and additions to this T&amp;Cs at the time you apply as
      published at the Hnry App or Hnry Website). By your continued use of the

        &ldquo;proscribed person&rdquo;, you acknowledge that we may be required
        to block access to the Card and/or Card Fund and immediately refuse to
        process or complete any transaction or suspend or terminate our
        arrangements with you. You agree that under these circumstances we are
        under no liability to you.
      </li>

        without incurring any liability if we suspect that the transaction:
